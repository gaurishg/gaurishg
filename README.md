## Projects
Some of my projects which I developed either out of interest or while learning a new technology are listed below

### Notes to Hierarchical PDF (Python, PyPDF2)
Bored of pausing video lectures and writing what the instructor has already written in the video? Now just take screenshots while watching and run this Python script. It'll traverse the hierachy of your folder structure and will create a pdf file with properly annotated bookmarks for you to refer later.

Take a look at the https://github.com/gaurishg/vlc-screenshots-to-notes-pdf for more details.

### Translango (Fullstack Project using React, Typescript, MUI, Python, FastAPI, GCP)
Planning to visit a foreign country but don't know the language? Don't worry, we have got you covered!
*Translango* is a website where you can 
- translate text of one language into another
- Upload a picture and get the name of objects in another language
- Play a game to learn new words in a foreign language

It was developed with the help of amazing team of fellow UTokyo students, [Megha Sharma](https://github.com/ms3744), [Nakai](https://github.com/nnaakkaaii), [Rodrigo Curiel](https://github.com/ccurielrodrigo) and [Kunsheng](https://github.com/likunsheng).

We had used following technologies in the project:
- Frontend: React with Typescript + MUI 
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- Cloud Services: Google Cloud Translate for translation; Google Cloud Vision for object detection; Google Cloud Run for backend code deployment and CI/CD for backend, Google Cloud Storage for storing images; AWS Amplify for deploying and setting up CI/CD for frontend
- Docker: We used docker locally as well for deploying our app on the cloud
